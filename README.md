# Sea Port Application
Java project from my university.

Creating this project was a task from GUI exercises on my University (PJATK).

All the instructions on how the application should work can be found in Instruction.pdf

In short, is a console application used for managing a seaport.

Some functionalities: 
-creating new containers and ships of any available type with specified parameters, 
-loading and unloading containers on the ships/train/warehouse, 
-saving/loading data,
-simulate passing time using threads,
-saving storage time of containers in the warehouse, 
-throwing an exception if a container was disposed of,
-if the train is full, its departures and after 30s new one arrives 

This project is finished and it's unlikely that I'll add anything new.
